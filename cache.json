Presently, there are no positioning\nsystems available that are suited for real-world use in confined underwater\nenvironments, unconstrained by environmental lighting and water turbidity\nlevels and have sufficient accuracy for long-term, reliable and repeatable\nnavigation. This shortage presents a significant barrier to enhancing the\ncapabilities of ROVs in such scenarios. This paper introduces an innovative\npositioning system for ROVs operating in confined, cluttered underwater\nsettings, achieved through the collaboration of an omnidirectional surface\nvehicle and an ROV. A formulation is proposed and evaluated in the simulation\nagainst ground truth.

Recently, research in surface completion has evolved from small\nobjects to complex large-scale scenes. As a result, researchers have begun\nincreasing the volume of data and leveraging a greater variety of data\nmodalities including rendered RGB images, descriptive texts, depth images, etc,\nto enhance algorithm performance. However, existing datasets suffer from a\ndeficiency in the amounts of scene-level models along with the corresponding\nmulti-modal information. Therefore, a method to scale the datasets and generate\nmulti-modal information in them efficiently is essential. To bridge this\nresearch gap, we propose MASSTAR: a Multi-modal lArge-scale Scene dataset with\na verSatile Toolchain for surfAce pRediction and completion. We develop a\nversatile and efficient toolchain for processing the raw 3D data from the\nenvironments. It screens out a set of fine-grained scene models and generates\nthe corresponding multi-modal data. Utilizing the toolchain, we then generate\nan example dataset composed of over a thousand scene-level models with partial\nreal-world data added. We compare MASSTAR with the existing datasets, which\nvalidates its superiority: the ability to efficiently extract high-quality\nmodels from complex scenarios to expand the dataset. Additionally, several\nrepresentative surface completion algorithms are benchmarked on MASSTAR, which\nreveals that existing algorithms can hardly deal with scene-level completion.\nWe will release the source code of our toolchain and the dataset.

Furthermore, in a pioneering effort, we introduce\nsemantic annotations of 29 classes over 59k sparse NRE lidar scans across three\ndomains, thus providing a novel challenge to existing semantic segmentation\nresearch upon this largely unexplored lidar modality. Finally, we propose, for\nthe first time to the best of our knowledge, continuous-time ground truth based\non optimization-based registration of lidar-inertial data on large survey-grade\nprior maps, which are also publicly released, each several times the size of\nexisting ones. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of numerous state-of-the-art\nalgorithms on MCD, report their performance, and highlight the challenges\nawaiting solutions from the research community.\n","authors":["Thien-Minh Nguyen","Shenghai Yuan","Thien Hoang Nguyen","Pengyu Yin","Haozhi Cao","Lihua Xie","Maciej Wozniak","Patric Jensfelt","Marko Thiel","Justin Ziegenbein","Noel Blunder"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11496v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern\n  Recognition 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11492v1","updated":"2024-03-18T05:53:20Z","published":"2024-03-18T05:53:20Z","title":"SmartRefine: An Scenario-Adaptive Refinement Framework for Efficient\n  Motion Prediction","summary":"  Predicting the future motion of surrounding agents is essential for\nautonomous vehicles (AVs) to operate safely in dynamic, human-robot-mixed\nenvironments. Context information, such as road maps and surrounding agents'\nstates, provides crucial geometric and semantic information for motion behavior\nprediction. To this end, recent works explore two-stage prediction frameworks\nwhere coarse trajectories are first proposed, and then used to select critical\ncontext information for trajectory refinement. However, they either incur a\nlarge amount of computation or bring limited improvement, if not both. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel scenario-adaptive refinement strategy, named\nSmartRefine, to refine prediction with minimal additional computation.\nSpecifically, SmartRefine can comprehensively adapt refinement configurations\nbased on each scenario's properties, and smartly chooses the number of\nrefinement iterations by introducing a quality score to measure the prediction\nquality and remaining refinement potential of each scenario. SmartRefine is\ndesigned as a generic and flexible approach that can be seamlessly integrated\ninto most state-of-the-art motion prediction models. Experiments on Argoverse\n(1 & 2) show that our method consistently improves the prediction accuracy of\nmultiple state-of-the-art prediction models. Specifically, by adding\nSmartRefine to QCNet, we outperform all published ensemble-free works on the\nArgoverse 2 leaderboard (single agent track) at submission. Comprehensive\nstudies are also conducted to ablate design choices and explore the mechanism\nbehind multi-iteration refinement.

Instead, we navigate the robot in free\nspace with an alternate starshaped decomposition, which is calculated directly\nfrom real-time sensor data. Additionally, a roadmap is constructed\nincrementally to maintain the connectivity information of the starshaped\nregions. Compared to the roadmap built upon connected polygons or ellipses in\nthe conventional approaches, the concave starshaped region is better suited to\ncapture the natural distribution of sensor data, so that the perception\ninformation can be fully exploited for robot navigation. In this sense,\nconservative and myopic behaviors are avoided with the proposed approach, and\nintricate obstacle configurations can be suitably accommodated in unknown and\ncluttered environments. Then, we design a heuristic exploration algorithm on\nthe roadmap to determine the frontier points of the starshaped regions, from\nwhich short-term goals are selected to attract the robot towards the goal\nconfiguration. It is noteworthy that, a recovery mechanism is developed on the\nroadmap that is triggered once a non-extendable short-term goal is reached.\nThis mechanism renders it possible to deal with dead-end situations that can be\ntypically encountered in unknown and cluttered environments.

The problem can be\nmore complicated with the existence of different physical constraints imposed\nby the robot structure. In this paper, we develop an inverse kinematics solver\nnamed IKSPARK (Inverse Kinematics using Semidefinite Programming And RanK\nminimization) that can find solutions for robots with various structures,\nincluding open/closed kinematic chains, spherical, revolute, and/or prismatic\njoints. The solver works in the space of rotation matrices of the link\nreference frames and involves solving only convex semidefinite problems (SDPs).\nSpecifically, the IK problem is formulated as an SDP with an additional rank-1\nconstraint on symmetric matrices with constant traces. The solver first solves\nthis SDP disregarding the rank constraint to get a start point and then finds\nthe rank-1 solution iteratively via a rank minimization algorithm with proven\nlocal convergence.

Consider an adult with motor impairments controlling an assistive robot\narm to eat dinner. The robot can reduce the number of human inputs -- and how\nprecise those inputs need to be -- by recognizing what the human wants (e.g., a\nfork) and assisting for that task (e.g., moving towards the fork). Prior\nresearch has largely focused on learning the human's task and providing\nmeaningful assistance.

In this paper, we study the effects of\ncommunicating learned assistance from the robot back to the human operator. We\ndo not focus on the specific interfaces used for communication.

To address this we present SceneScene, a real-time 3D diffusion\nmodel for synthesizing 3D occupancy information from partial observations that\neffectively predicts these occluded or out of view geometries for use in future\nplanning and control frameworks.

By learning the\nmanifold's Euclidean embedded representation, our approach encodes the\nnon-linearity of the DS within the curvature of the space. Having an explicit\nembedded representation of the manifold allows us to showcase obstacle\navoidance by directly inducing local deformations of the space.

In this context, the\nstrategic integration of a visual prior into the training dataset emerges as a\npotential solution to enhance congruity with the testing data distribution,\nconsequently reducing the dependency on computational resources and the need\nfor highly complex models. However, effectively embedding a visual prior into\nthe learning process remains a complex endeavor. Addressing this challenge, we\nintroduce the MISS (Memory-efficient Instance Segmentation System) framework.\nMISS leverages visual inductive prior flow propagation, integrating intrinsic\nprior knowledge from the Synergy-basketball dataset at various stages: data\npreprocessing, augmentation, training, and inference. Our empirical evaluations\nunderscore the efficacy of MISS, demonstrating commendable performance in\nscenarios characterized by limited data availability and memory constraints.\n","authors":["Chih-Chung Hsu","Chia-Ming Lee"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11576v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00766v2","updated":"2024-03-18T08:51:58Z","published":"2024-01-01T14:14:35Z","title":"Exposure Bracketing is All You Need for Unifying Image Restoration and\n  Enhancement Tasks","summary":"  It is highly desired but challenging to acquire high-quality photos with\nclear content in low-light environments.

However, we find that the optimal number\nof inversion steps for achieving ideal editing results varies significantly\namong different editing pairs, owing to varying editing difficulties.\nTherefore, the current literature, which relies on a fixed number of inversion\nsteps, produces sub-optimal generation quality, especially when handling\nmultiple editing pairs in a natural image.

However, imperfectness in\ntask-selection may lead to negative impacts on the performance particularly in\nthe scenarios where the number of tasks is large or task distributions are\nimbalanced. To address this issue, we introduce I-Prompt, a task-agnostic\napproach focuses on the visual semantic information of image tokens to\neliminate task prediction. Our method consists of semantic prompt matching,\nwhich determines prompts based on similarities between tokens, and image\ntoken-level prompting, which applies prompts directly to image tokens in the\nintermediate layers. Consequently, our method achieves competitive performance\non four benchmarks while significantly reducing training time compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod across various scenarios through extensive experiments.\n","authors":["Jisu Han","Jaemin Na","Wonjun Hwang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11537v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11536v1","updated":"2024-03-18T07:41:39Z","published":"2024-03-18T07:41:39Z","title":"OCR is All you need: Importing Multi-Modality into Image-based Defect\n  Detection System","summary":"  Automatic optical inspection (AOI) plays a pivotal role in the manufacturing\nprocess, predominantly leveraging high-resolution imaging instruments for\nscanning purposes.

It is difficult to exploit the mesh\nto depict the fuzzy geometry. Meanwhile, the point-based splatting (e.g. the 3D\nGaussian Splatting) method usually produces artifacts or blurry pixels in the\narea with smooth geometry and sharp textures. As a result, it is difficult,\neven not impossible, to represent the complex and dynamic scene with a single\ntype of primitive. To this end, we propose a novel approach, GauMesh, to bridge\nthe 3D Gaussian and Mesh for modeling and rendering the dynamic scenes. Given a\nsequence of tracked mesh as initialization, our goal is to simultaneously\noptimize the mesh geometry, color texture, opacity maps, a set of 3D Gaussians,\nand the deformation field. At a specific time, we perform $\\alpha$-blending on\nthe RGB and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffers from\nmesh and 3D Gaussian rasterizations. This produces the final rendering, which\nis supervised by the ground-truth image. Experiments demonstrate that our\napproach adapts the appropriate type of primitives to represent the different\nparts of the dynamic scene and outperforms all the baseline methods in both\nquantitative and qualitative comparisons without losing render speed.\n","authors":["Yuting Xiao","Xuan Wang","Jiafei Li","Hongrui Cai","Yanbo Fan","Nan Xue","Minghui Yang","Yujun Shen","Shenghua Gao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11453v1.pdf","comment":"7 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11451v1","updated":"2024-03-18T03:59:43Z","published":"2024-03-18T03:59:43Z","title":"CasSR: Activating Image Power for Real-World Image Super-Resolution","summary":"  The objective of image super-resolution is to generate clean and\nhigh-resolution images from degraded versions.

Many recent works have\nfocused on training adapter networks that serve as an information bridge\nbetween image processing networks and LLMs; but presumably, in order to achieve\nmaximum reasoning potential of LLMs on visual information as well, visual and\nlanguage features should be allowed to interact more freely.

In this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of hard pixel errors, categorizing them into three\ntypes: false responses, merging mistakes, and displacements. Our findings\nreveal a quantitative association between hard pixels and aliasing, which is\ndistortion caused by the overlapping of frequency components in the Fourier\ndomain during downsampling. To identify the frequencies responsible for\naliasing, we propose using the equivalent sampling rate to calculate the\nNyquist frequency, which marks the threshold for aliasing.

Despite its importance, little attention\nis paid to the performance of UAV trackers under common corruptions due to lack\nof a dedicated platform. Addressing this, we propose UAV-C, a large-scale\nbenchmark for assessing robustness of UAV trackers under common corruptions.\nSpecifically, UAV-C is built upon two popular UAV datasets by introducing 18\ncommon corruptions from 4 representative categories including adversarial,\nsensor, blur, and composite corruptions in different levels. Finally, UAV-C\ncontains more than 10K sequences. To understand the robustness of existing UAV\ntrackers against corruptions, we extensively evaluate 12 representative\nalgorithms on UAV-C. Our study reveals several key findings: 1) Current\ntrackers are vulnerable to corruptions, indicating more attention needed in\nenhancing the robustness of UAV trackers; 2) When accompanying together,\ncomposite corruptions result in more severe degradation to trackers; and 3)\nWhile each tracker has its unique performance profile, some trackers may be\nmore sensitive to specific corruptions. By releasing UAV-C, we hope it, along\nwith comprehensive analysis, serves as a valuable resource for advancing the\nrobustness of UAV tracking against corruption.

Existing work concentrated on optimizing the\nencoder, yet has not adequately addressed the inefficiency of the attention\nmechanism itself, even when distilled to a smaller model, which thus leaves\nspace for further improvement. In response, we introduce SAM-Lightening, a\nvariant of SAM, that features a re-engineered attention mechanism, termed\nDilated Flash Attention.

However, they are very vulnerable\nto illumination variance, occlusions, texture-less regions, as well as moving\nobjects, making them not robust enough to deal with various scenes. To address\nthis challenge, we study two kinds of robust cross-view consistency in this\npaper. Firstly, the spatial offset field between adjacent frames is obtained by\nreconstructing the reference frame from its neighbors via deformable alignment,\nwhich is used to align the temporal depth features via a Depth Feature\nAlignment (DFA) loss. Secondly, the 3D point clouds of each reference frame and\nits nearby frames are calculated and transformed into voxel space, where the\npoint density in each voxel is calculated and aligned via a Voxel Density\nAlignment (VDA) loss. In this way, we exploit the temporal coherence in both\ndepth feature space and 3D voxel space for SS-MDE, shifting the\n\"point-to-point\" alignment paradigm to the \"region-to-region\" one.

It aims to input a piece of music and seed motions, then\ngenerate natural dance movements for the subsequent music. Transformer-based\nmethods face challenges in time series prediction tasks related to human\nmovements and music due to their struggle in capturing the nonlinear\nrelationship and temporal aspects. This can lead to issues like joint\ndeformation, role deviation, floating, and inconsistencies in dance movements\ngenerated in response to the music. In this paper, we propose a\nQuaternion-Enhanced Attention Network (QEAN) for visual dance synthesis from a\nquaternion perspective, which consists of a Spin Position Embedding (SPE)\nmodule and a Quaternion Rotary Attention (QRA) module. First, SPE embeds\nposition information into self-attention in a rotational manner, leading to\nbetter learning of features of movement sequences and audio sequences, and\nimproved understanding of the connection between music and dance. Second, QRA\nrepresents and fuses 3D motion features and audio features in the form of a\nseries of quaternions, enabling the model to better learn the temporal\ncoordination of music and dance under the complex temporal cycle conditions of\ndance generation.

As a result, it is difficult,\neven not impossible, to represent the complex and dynamic scene with a single\ntype of primitive. To this end, we propose a novel approach, GauMesh, to bridge\nthe 3D Gaussian and Mesh for modeling and rendering the dynamic scenes.

However, automatic detection of jersey numbers using deep features\nis challenging primarily due to: a) motion blur, b) low resolution video feed,\nand c) occlusions. With their recent success in various vision tasks, masked\nautoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a superior alternative to conventional\nfeature extractors. However, most MAEs simply zero-out image patches either\nrandomly or focus on where to mask rather than how to mask. Motivated by human\nvision, we devise a novel domain-guided masking policy for MAEs termed d-MAE to\nfacilitate robust feature extraction in the presence of motion blur for player\nidentification. We further introduce a new spatio-temporal network leveraging\nour novel d-MAE for unique player identification. We conduct experiments on\nthree large-scale sports datasets, including a curated baseball dataset, the\nSoccerNet dataset, and an in-house ice hockey dataset. We preprocess the\ndatasets using an upgraded keyframe identification (KfID) module by focusing on\nframes containing jersey numbers.

To this end, this paper proposes an Intention-Driven\nEgo-to-exo video generation framework (IDE) that leverages action intention\nconsisting of human movement and action description as view-independent\nrepresentation to guide video generation, preserving the consistency of content\nand motion. Specifically, the egocentric head trajectory is first estimated\nthrough multi-view stereo matching. Then, cross-view feature perception module\nis introduced to establish correspondences between exo- and ego- views, guiding\nthe trajectory transformation module to infer human full-body movement from the\nhead trajectory. Meanwhile, we present an action description unit that maps the\naction semantics into the feature space consistent with the exocentric image.\nFinally, the inferred human movement and high-level action descriptions jointly\nguide the generation of exocentric motion and interaction content (i.e.,\ncorresponding optical flow and occlusion maps) in the backward process of the\ndiffusion model, ultimately warping them into the corresponding exocentric\nvideo. We conduct extensive experiments on the relevant dataset with diverse\nexo-ego video pairs, and our IDE outperforms state-of-the-art models in both\nsubjective and objective assessments, demonstrating its efficacy in ego-to-exo\nvideo generation.\n","authors":["Hongchen Luo","Kai Zhu","Wei Zhai","Yang Cao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09194v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11211v1","updated":"2024-03-17T13:23:25Z","published":"2024-03-17T13:23:25Z","title":"RCdpia: A Renal Carcinoma Digital Pathology Image Annotation dataset\n  based on pathologists","summary":"  The annotation of digital pathological slide data for renal cell carcinoma is\nof paramount importance for correct diagnosis of artificial intelligence models\ndue to the heterogeneous nature of the tumor.

To address this problem, this work proposes NetTrack, an\nefficient, generic, and affordable tracking framework to introduce fine-grained\nlearning that is robust to dynamicity.

To this end, recent works explore two-stage prediction frameworks\nwhere coarse trajectories are first proposed, and then used to select critical\ncontext information for trajectory refinement. However, they either incur a\nlarge amount of computation or bring limited improvement, if not both. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel scenario-adaptive refinement strategy, named\nSmartRefine, to refine prediction with minimal additional computation.\nSpecifically, SmartRefine can comprehensively adapt refinement configurations\nbased on each scenario's properties, and smartly chooses the number of\nrefinement iterations by introducing a quality score to measure the prediction\nquality and remaining refinement potential of each scenario. SmartRefine is\ndesigned as a generic and flexible approach that can be seamlessly integrated\ninto most state-of-the-art motion prediction models. Experiments on Argoverse\n(1 & 2) show that our method consistently improves the prediction accuracy of\nmultiple state-of-the-art prediction models. Specifically, by adding\nSmartRefine to QCNet, we outperform all published ensemble-free works on the\nArgoverse 2 leaderboard (single agent track) at submission.

Existing RAF methods primarily focus on solid foods, leaving a gap in\nmanipulation strategies for semi-solid and deformable foods. This study\nintroduces Long-horizon Visual Action (LAVA) based food acquisition of liquid,\nsemisolid, and deformable foods. Long-horizon refers to the goal of \"clearing\nthe bowl\" by sequentially acquiring the food from the bowl. LAVA employs a\nhierarchical policy for long-horizon food acquisition tasks. The framework uses\nhigh-level policy to determine primitives by leveraging ScoopNet. At the\nmid-level, LAVA finds parameters for primitives using vision. To carry out\nsequential plans in the real world, LAVA delegates action execution which is\ndriven by Low-level policy that uses parameters received from mid-level policy\nand behavior cloning ensuring precise trajectory execution. We validate our\napproach on complex real-world acquisition trials involving granular, liquid,\nsemisolid, and deformable food types along with fruit chunks and soup\nacquisition. Across 46 bowls, LAVA acquires much more efficiently than\nbaselines with a success rate of 89 +/- 4% and generalizes across realistic\nplate variations such as different positions, varieties, and amount of food in\nthe bowl.

Given such correspondences, the method then jointly optimizes\nlandmark and vehicle position estimates. Indoor and outdoor underwater datasets\nwith a wide variety of objects and challenging acoustic and lighting conditions\nare collected for evaluation and made publicly available. Quantitative and\nqualitative results show the proposed method achieves reduced trajectory error\ncompared to baseline methods, and is able to obtain comparable map accuracy to\na baseline closed-set method that requires hand-labeled data of all objects in\nthe scene.\n","authors":["Kurran Singh","Jungseok Hong","Nicholas R.

A standard approach for such a problem is learning a feature\nspace of images where Euclidean distances reflect similarity. Even without\nhuman annotations, which may be expensive to acquire, prior methods function\nreasonably well using unlabeled images for training. Our problem constraint\ntakes this further to scenarios where the two domains do not necessarily share\nany common categories in training data.

Event cameras offer unique advantages for\nbattery-dependent remote monitoring due to their low power consumption and high\ndynamic range capabilities.

(ii) the meta-test phase applies the frozen\nfeature extractor to novel data (novel data has different categories from base\ndata) and designs a classifier for recognition. To correct few-shot data\ndistribution, researchers propose Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning (SSFSL) by\nintroducing unlabeled data. Although SSFSL has been proved to achieve\noutstanding performances in the FSL community, there still exists a fundamental\nproblem: the pre-trained feature extractor can not adapt to the novel data\nflawlessly due to the cross-category setting. Usually, large amounts of noises\nare introduced to the novel feature. We dub it as Feature-Extractor-Maladaptive\n(FEM) problem. To tackle FEM, we make two efforts in this paper.

While a promising alternative is the use of\nsynthesized medical data, there are few solutions for realistic 3D medical\nimage synthesis due to difficulties in backbone design and fewer 3D training\nsamples compared to 2D counterparts. In this paper, we propose GEM-3D, a novel\ngenerative approach to the synthesis of 3D medical images and the enhancement\nof existing datasets using conditional diffusion models. Our method begins with\na 2D slice, noted as the informed slice to serve the patient prior, and\npropagates the generation process using a 3D segmentation mask. By decomposing\nthe 3D medical images into masks and patient prior information, GEM-3D offers a\nflexible yet effective solution for generating versatile 3D images from\nexisting datasets. GEM-3D can enable dataset enhancement by combining informed\nslice selection and generation at random positions, along with editable mask\nvolumes to introduce large variations in diffusion sampling.

SAM, known for its zero-shot generalizability,\nexhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image\nsizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt\nstructure modifications, hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior\nknowledge. Besides, such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete\nretraining of the model, which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for\ndeployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we reformulate this issue as\na length extrapolation problem, where token sequence length varies while\nmaintaining a consistent patch size for images of different sizes. To this end,\nwe propose Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's\nadaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for\nstructure modifications.

However, their limited model capacity typically results in\nblurred rendering results. Existing large-scale NeRFs primarily address this\nlimitation by partitioning the scene into blocks, which are subsequently\nhandled by separate sub-NeRFs. These sub-NeRFs, trained from scratch and\nprocessed independently, lead to inconsistencies in geometry and appearance\nacross the scene. Consequently, the rendering quality fails to exhibit\nsignificant improvement despite the expansion of model capacity. In this work,\nwe present global-guided focal neural radiance field (GF-NeRF) that achieves\nhigh-fidelity rendering of large-scale scenes. Our proposed GF-NeRF utilizes a\ntwo-stage (Global and Focal) architecture and a global-guided training\nstrategy. The global stage obtains a continuous representation of the entire\nscene while the focal stage decomposes the scene into multiple blocks and\nfurther processes them with distinct sub-encoders. Leveraging this two-stage\narchitecture, sub-encoders only need fine-tuning based on the global encoder,\nthus reducing training complexity in the focal stage while maintaining\nscene-wide consistency. Spatial information and error information from the\nglobal stage also benefit the sub-encoders to focus on crucial areas and\neffectively capture more details of large-scale scenes. Notably, our approach\ndoes not rely on any prior knowledge about the target scene, attributing\nGF-NeRF adaptable to various large-scale scene types, including street-view and\naerial-view scenes.

Scribble-supervised learning emerges as a possible\nsolution to this challenge, promising a reduction in annotation efforts when\ncreating large-scale datasets. Recently, a plethora of methods for optimized\nlearning from scribbles have been proposed, but have so far failed to position\nscribble annotation as a beneficial alternative. We relate this shortcoming to\ntwo major issues: 1) the complex nature of many methods which deeply ties them\nto the underlying segmentation model, thus preventing a migration to more\npowerful state-of-the-art models as the field progresses and 2) the lack of a\nsystematic evaluation to validate consistent performance across the broader\nmedical domain, resulting in a lack of trust when applying these methods to new\nsegmentation problems. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive\nscribble supervision benchmark consisting of seven datasets covering a diverse\nset of anatomies and pathologies imaged with varying modalities. We furthermore\npropose the systematic use of partial losses, i.e. losses that are only\ncomputed on annotated voxels.

Inspired by the remarkable success of pre-trained plain\nVision Transformers (ViTs), we introduce a novel single-modality gaze following\nframework, ViTGaze. In contrast to previous methods, ViTGaze creates a brand\nnew gaze following framework based mainly on powerful encoders (dec. param.\nless than 1%). Our principal insight lies in that the inter-token interactions\nwithin self-attention can be transferred to interactions between humans and\nscenes. Leveraging this presumption, we formulate a framework consisting of a\n4D interaction encoder and a 2D spatial guidance module to extract human-scene\ninteraction information from self-attention maps. Furthermore, our\ninvestigation reveals that ViT with self-supervised pre-training exhibits an\nenhanced ability to extract correlated information. A large number of\nexperiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed\nmethod. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among all\nsingle-modality methods (3.4% improvement on AUC, 5.1% improvement on AP) and\nvery comparable performance against multi-modality methods with 59% number of\nparameters less.\n","authors":["Yuehao Song","Xinggang Wang","Jingfeng Yao","Wenyu Liu","Jinglin Zhang","Xiangmin Xu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12778v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12777v1","updated":"2024-03-19T14:44:54Z","published":"2024-03-19T14:44:54Z","title":"Discover and Mitigate Multiple Biased Subgroups in Image Classifiers","summary":"  Machine learning models can perform well on in-distribution data but often\nfail on biased subgroups that are underrepresented in the training data,\nhindering the robustness of models for reliable applications. Such subgroups\nare typically unknown due to the absence of subgroup labels. Discovering biased\nsubgroups is the key to understanding models' failure modes and further\nimproving models' robustness. Most previous works of subgroup discovery make an\nimplicit assumption that models only underperform on a single biased subgroup,\nwhich does not hold on in-the-wild data where multiple biased subgroups exist.\n  In this work, we propose Decomposition, Interpretation, and Mitigation (DIM),\na novel method to address a more challenging but also more practical problem of\ndiscovering multiple biased subgroups in image classifiers. Our approach\ndecomposes the image features into multiple components that represent multiple\nsubgroups. This decomposition is achieved via a bilinear dimension reduction\nmethod, Partial Least Square (PLS), guided by useful supervision from the image\nclassifier. We further interpret the semantic meaning of each subgroup\ncomponent by generating natural language descriptions using vision-language\nfoundation models. Finally, DIM mitigates multiple biased subgroups\nsimultaneously via two strategies, including the data- and model-centric\nstrategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Breeds datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DIM in discovering and mitigating multiple biased\nsubgroups. Furthermore, DIM uncovers the failure modes of the classifier on\nHard ImageNet, showcasing its broader applicability to understanding model bias\nin image classifiers.

Specifically, PGA acquires personal object information by\na user presenting a personal object with its associated indicator, followed by\nPGA inspecting the object by rotating it. Based on the acquired information,\nPGA pseudo-labels objects in the Reminiscence by our proposed label propagation\nalgorithm. Harnessing the information acquired from the interactions and the\npseudo-labeled objects in the Reminiscence, PGA adapts the object grounding\nmodel to grasp personal objects. This results in significant efficiency while\nprevious LCRG systems rely on resource-intensive human annotations --\nnecessitating hundreds of labeled data to learn my wallet. Moreover, PGA\noutperforms baseline methods across all metrics and even shows comparable\nperformance compared to the fully-supervised method, which learns from 9k\nannotated data samples. We further validate PGA's real-world applicability by\nemploying a physical robot to execute GrsapMine.

The success of\ndiffusion models lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks\ndown the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple\ndenoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the\ngeneration process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step.\nHowever, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking\nfrom tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency\ntrajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the\nprobability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function\nevaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. Thus, this\nwork aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs\n(GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, empowered by a 2D\ndiffusion-based in-painting model, to reconstruct complete surfaces for the\nhidden parts of objects. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained diffusion model\nto fill in the hidden areas of 2D images. Then we use these in-painted images\nto optimize a neural implicit surface representation for each instance for 3D\nreconstruction. Since creating the in-painting masks needed for this process is\ntricky, we adopt a human-in-the-loop strategy that involves very little human\nengagement to generate high-quality masks.

In\nparticular, due to the distinct modality gap with the image-text data and the\nlack of large-scale datasets, learning a common representation space for\nimages, texts, and events is non-trivial.Intuitively, we need to address two\nkey challenges: 1) how to generalize CLIP's visual encoder to event data while\nfully leveraging events' unique properties, e.g., sparsity and high temporal\nresolution; 2) how to effectively align the multi-modal embeddings, i.e.,\nimage, text, and events. Accordingly, we first introduce a novel event encoder\nthat subtly models the temporal information from events and meanwhile,\ngenerates event prompts for modality bridging. We then design a text encoder\nthat generates content prompts and utilizes hybrid text prompts to enhance\nEventBind's generalization ability across diverse datasets.With the proposed\nevent encoder, text encoder, and image encoder, a novel Hierarchical Triple\nContrastive Alignment (HTCA) module is introduced to jointly optimize the\ncorrelation and enable efficient knowledge transfer among the three modalities.\nWe evaluate various settings, including fine-tuning and few-shot on three\nbenchmarks, and our EventBind achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy compared\nwith the previous methods, such as on N-Caltech101 (+5.34% and +1.70%) and\nN-Imagenet (+5.65% and +1.99%) with fine-tuning and 20-shot settings,\nrespectively.

A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates\nthat augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the\noptimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples\nsignificantly.

To deal with this issue, we propose a fully self-supervised framework,\nnamed cascaded multi-view aggregating network (CMANet), to construct a\ncanonical parameter space to holistically integrate and exploit multi-view\ninformation.

Despite the existing substantial efforts,\nsimultaneously ensuring model effectiveness and parameter efficiency remains\nchallenging in this scenario. In this paper, we propose a lightweight yet\neffective Group-wise Rotating and Attention (GRA) module to replace the\nconvolution operations in backbone networks for oriented object detection. GRA\ncan adaptively capture fine-grained features of objects with diverse\norientations, comprising two key components: Group-wise Rotating and Group-wise\nAttention. Group-wise Rotating first divides the convolution kernel into\ngroups, where each group extracts different object features by rotating at a\nspecific angle according to the object orientation. Subsequently, Group-wise\nAttention is employed to adaptively enhance the object-related regions in the\nfeature. The collaborative effort of these components enables GRA to\neffectively capture the various orientation information while maintaining\nparameter efficiency.

In this work we\nutilize the multidimensional coordinate Hermite spline interpolation defined on\nnon-equal spaced, rectilinear grids and apply it to a very common image\nprocessing task, image zooming. Since Hermite interpolation utilizes function\nvalues, as well as partial derivative values, it is natural to apply it to\nimage processing tasks as a special case of equi-spaced grid, using numerical\napproximations of the image partial derivatives at each pixel. Furthermore, the\ntask of image interpolation requires the calculation of image values at\npositions with nono-zero fractional part. Thus, any spline interpolation can be\nwritten as convolution with an appropriate kernel. In this context we generate\nthe Hermite kernels according to the derived $n-$dimensional interpolant of\nTheorem 2 in [1]. We show that despite the increased complexity of the\ninterpolant, once the kernels are constructed, the Hermite spline interpolation\ncan be applied to images as efficiently as any other less complicated method.\nFinally, we perform illustrative numerical examples to showcase the\napplicability and high accuracy of the proposed Hermite kernels for image\nzooming, compared to other interpolation methods, both traditional\nconvolution-based, as well as employing deep learning, in terms of PSNR, as\nwell as SSIM error metrics.

The prevailing methods for estimating uncertainty,\nincluding the state-of-the-art Density-aware NeRF Ensembles (DANE) [29],\nquantify uncertainty without calibration.

In this paper, we propose a method which, for the first time,\nachieves calibrated uncertainties for NeRFs.

This issue is particularly problematic in\nsparse-view settings, where we can operate with as few as three images. To\naddress this, we introduce the concept of a meta-calibrator that performs\nuncertainty calibration for NeRFs with a single forward pass without the need\nfor holding out any images from the target scene. Our meta-calibrator is a\nneural network that takes as input the NeRF images and uncalibrated uncertainty\nmaps and outputs a scene-specific calibration curve that corrects the NeRF's\nuncalibrated uncertainties. We show that the meta-calibrator can generalize on\nunseen scenes and achieves well-calibrated and state-of-the-art uncertainty for\nNeRFs, significantly beating DANE and other approaches.

One framework here is\nreinforcement learning, where the robot is given a reward function that encodes\nthe task, and the robot autonomously learns actions to maximize its reward.\nExisting approaches to reinforcement learning often frame this problem as a\nMarkov decision process, and learn a policy (or a hierarchy of policies) to\ncomplete the task. These policies reason over hundreds of fine-grained actions\nthat the robot arm needs to take: e.g., moving slightly to the right or\nrotating the end-effector a few degrees. But the manipulation tasks that we\nwant robots to perform can often be broken down into a small number of\nhigh-level motions: e.g., reaching an object or turning a handle. In this paper\nwe therefore propose a waypoint-based approach for model-free reinforcement\nlearning. Instead of learning a low-level policy, the robot now learns a\ntrajectory of waypoints, and then interpolates between those waypoints using\nexisting controllers. Our key novelty is framing this waypoint-based setting as\na sequence of multi-armed bandits: each bandit problem corresponds to one\nwaypoint along the robot's motion.

This paper proposes a method to remedy this\nprocess by considering hardware-level reusability, using\nLearning-from-observation (LfO) paradigm with a pre-designed skill-agent\nlibrary. The LfO framework represents the required actions in\nhardware-independent representations, referred to as task models, from\nobserving human demonstrations, capturing the necessary parameters for the\ninteraction between the environment and the robot. When executing the desired\nactions from the task models, a set of skill agents is employed to convert the\nrepresentations into robot commands. This paper focuses on the latter part of\nthe LfO framework, utilizing the set to generate robot actions from the task\nmodels, and explores a hardware-independent design approach for these skill\nagents. These skill agents are described in a hardware-independent manner,\nconsidering the relative relationship between the robot's hand position and the\nenvironment. As a result, it is possible to execute these actions on robots\nwith different hardware configurations by simply swapping the inverse\nkinematics solver.

In this work, we present\nRadSplat, a lightweight method for robust real-time rendering of complex\nscenes. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we use radiance fields as\na prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene\nrepresentations, leading to improved quality and more robust optimization.\nNext, we develop a novel pruning technique reducing the overall point count\nwhile maintaining high quality, leading to smaller and more compact scene\nrepresentations with faster inference speeds. Finally, we propose a novel\ntest-time filtering approach that further accelerates rendering and allows to\nscale to larger, house-sized scenes. We find that our method enables\nstate-of-the-art synthesis of complex captures at 900+ FPS.\n","authors":["Michael Niemeyer","Fabian Manhardt","Marie-Julie Rakotosaona","Michael Oechsle","Daniel Duckworth","Rama Gosula","Keisuke Tateno","John Bates","Dominik Kaeser","Federico Tombari"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13806v1.pdf","comment":"Project page at https://m-niemeyer.github.io/radsplat/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13804v1","updated":"2024-03-20T17:59:43Z","published":"2024-03-20T17:59:43Z","title":"Learning from Models and Data for Visual Grounding","summary":"  We introduce SynGround, a novel framework that combines data-driven learning\nand knowledge transfer from various large-scale pretrained models to enhance\nthe visual grounding capabilities of a pretrained vision-and-language model.\nThe knowledge transfer from the models initiates the generation of image\ndescriptions through an image description generator.

However, in the\nreal-world where test ground truths are not provided, it is non-trivial to find\nout whether bounding boxes are accurate, thus preventing us from assessing the\ndetector generalization ability. In this work, we find under feature map\ndropout, good detectors tend to output bounding boxes whose locations do not\nchange much, while bounding boxes of poor detectors will undergo noticeable\nposition changes. We compute the box stability score (BoS score) to reflect\nthis stability. Specifically, given an image, we compute a normal set of\nbounding boxes and a second set after feature map dropout. To obtain BoS score,\nwe use bipartite matching to find the corresponding boxes between the two sets\nand compute the average Intersection over Union (IoU) across the entire test\nset. We contribute to finding that BoS score has a strong, positive correlation\nwith detection accuracy measured by mean average precision (mAP) under various\ntest environments.

Thus, a promising zero-shot image classification strategy is\nselecting the most appropriate Pre-Trained VLM from the VLM Zoo, relying solely\non the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images.\nIn this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a\nVLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the \"Modality Gap\" -- the disparity in\nVLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable\nsubstitute for images; and the \"Capability Gap\" -- the discrepancy between the\nVLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct\nprediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general\nperformance.

However,\ntraditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions,\nsuch as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research\naddresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called\nIrregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular\nrepetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:\nInter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle\nConsistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of\ncycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval\ninconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle\nsegments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To\nencapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes\nconsistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss\n(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence\namong cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of\ncycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the\nRepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in\nVAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional\nadaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming\nexisting models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the\nneed for dataset-specific optimization.

Our framework is currently evaluated on simple formation\ntargets, limited to contour shapes. A formation is visually represented through\nalpha-shape contours and the most representative color is automatically found\nfor the input word. To measure the similarity between the description and the\nvisual representation of the formation, we use CLIP [1], encoding text and\nimages into vectors and assessing their similarity. Subsequently, the algorithm\nrearranges the formation to visually represent the word more effectively,\nwithin the given constraints of available drones. Control actions are then\nassigned to the drones, ensuring robotic behavior and collision-free movement.\nExperimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy in accurately modeling\nrobot formations from natural language descriptions. The algorithm's\nversatility is showcased through the execution of drone shows in photorealistic\nsimulation with varying shapes.

Previous works adopt the conventional\nclassification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a\nclassifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks\nor classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding\nto one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters\nof a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains\nall historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually\nrequired to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic\nforgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named\nAttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks.\nSpecifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model\nCLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from\nboth images and text.

The attribute prompts,\nwhich encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively\nmitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory. We\nevaluate our AttriCLIP and compare it with CLIP-based and previous\nstate-of-the-art continual learning methods in realistic settings with\ndomain-shift and long-sequence learning.

Given one modality-missing scenario, we propose to\nutilize the available modality to generate the prompt of the missing modality\nto adapt to RGBT tracking model. However, the cross-modality gap between\navailable and missing modalities usually causes semantic distortion and\ninformation loss in prompt generation. To handle this issue, we design the\ninvertible prompter by incorporating the full reconstruction of the input\navailable modality from the generated prompt. To provide a comprehensive\nevaluation platform, we construct several high-quality benchmark datasets, in\nwhich various modality-missing scenarios are considered to simulate real-world\nchallenges.

Traditional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging\n(T1-MRI) research focus on identifying brain atrophy regions but often fails to\naddress the intricate connectivity between them. This limitation underscores\nthe necessity of focuing on inter-regional connectivity for a comprehensive\nunderstand of the brain's complex network.

These\nare essential for developing high-quality feature representations that reveal\ncritical spatial impacts of structural brain changes and its topology. In this\npaper, we propose Brain-SubGNN, a novel graph representation network to mine\nand enhance critical subgraphs based on T1-MRI. This network provides a\nsubgraph-level interpretation, enhancing interpretability and insights for\ngraph analysis.

The condition is pretty common in the real world. It\ncauses low-contrast images where details are concealed in the darkness and\ncamera sensor noise significantly degrades the image quality. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose to learn to decompose illumination, reflectance, and noise\nfrom input views according to that reflectance remains invariant across\nheterogeneous views. To cope with heterogeneous brightness and noise levels\nacross multi-views, we learn an illumination embedding and optimize a noise map\nindividually for each view.

We point out that MiO\nIR faces two pivotal challenges: the optimization of diverse objectives and the\nadaptation to multiple tasks. To tackle these challenges, we present two simple\nyet effective strategies. The first strategy, referred to as sequential\nlearning, attempts to address how to optimize the diverse objectives, which\nguides the network to incrementally learn individual IR tasks in a sequential\nmanner rather than mixing them together. The second strategy, i.e., prompt\nlearning, attempts to address how to adapt to the different IR tasks, which\nassists the network to understand the specific task and improves the\ngeneralization ability. By evaluating on 19 test sets, we demonstrate that the\nsequential and prompt learning strategies can significantly enhance the MiO\nperformance of commonly used CNN and Transformer backbones.

Pioneering\nworks like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition.\nHowever, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps\nare independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single\nlinear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously.

In this way, the input and output could be represented in a\nunified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible.\nHowever, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units\n-words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal\nand semantic relations.

A recent\ninnovation, keypoint scene coordinate regression (KSCR) named D2S addresses\nthese issues by leveraging graph attention networks to enhance keypoint\nrelationships and predict their 3D coordinates using a simple multilayer\nperceptron (MLP). Camera pose is then determined via PnP+RANSAC, using\nestablished 2D-3D correspondences. While KSCR achieves competitive results,\nrivaling state-of-the-art image-retrieval methods like HLoc across multiple\nbenchmarks, its performance is hindered when data samples are limited due to\nthe deep learning model's reliance on extensive data. This paper proposes a\nsolution to this challenge by introducing a pipeline for keypoint descriptor\nsynthesis using Neural Radiance Field (NeRF).

Because of the variability, designing a unified framework to tackle this\ntask is challenging. The challenges can be summarized as the dilemma of being\nable to simultaneously estimate arbitrary camera poses and recover human mesh\nfrom arbitrary multi-view images while maintaining flexibility. To solve this\ndilemma, we propose a divide and conquer framework for Unified Human Mesh\nRecovery (U-HMR) from arbitrary multi-view images. In particular, U-HMR\nconsists of a decoupled structure and two main components: camera and body\ndecoupling (CBD), camera pose estimation (CPE), and arbitrary view fusion\n(AVF). As camera poses and human body mesh are independent of each other, CBD\nsplits the estimation of them into two sub-tasks for two individual\nsub-networks (\\ie, CPE and AVF) to handle respectively, thus the two sub-tasks\nare disentangled. In CPE, since each camera pose is unrelated to the others, we\nadopt a shared MLP to process all views in a parallel way. In AVF, in order to\nfuse multi-view information and make the fusion operation independent of the\nnumber of views, we introduce a transformer decoder with a SMPL parameters\nquery token to extract cross-view features for mesh recovery.

In this paper, we reformulate this issue as\na length extrapolation problem, where token sequence length varies while\nmaintaining a consistent patch size for images of different sizes. To this end,\nwe propose Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's\nadaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for\nstructure modifications.

To\naddress this, domain generalization is employed. Current methodologies in\ndomain generalization for 3D human pose estimation typically utilize\nadversarial training to generate synthetic poses for training. Nonetheless,\nthese approaches exhibit several limitations. First, the lack of prior\ninformation about the target domain complicates the application of suitable\naugmentation through a single pose augmentor, affecting generalization on\ntarget domains. Moreover, adversarial training's discriminator tends to enforce\nsimilarity between source and synthesized poses, impeding the exploration of\nout-of-source distributions. Furthermore, the pose estimator's optimization is\nnot exposed to domain shifts, limiting its overall generalization ability.\n  To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework featuring two pose\naugmentors: the weak and the strong augmentors.

However, joint manipulation of moving objects and\nlocomotion with legs, such as playing soccer, receive scant attention in the\nlearning community, although it is natural for humans and smart animals. A key\nchallenge to solve this multitask problem is to infer the objectives of\nlocomotion from the states and targets of the manipulated objects. The implicit\nrelation between the object states and robot locomotion can be hard to capture\ndirectly from the training experience. We propose adding a feedback control\nblock to compute the necessary body-level movement accurately and using the\noutputs as dynamic joint-level locomotion supervision explicitly.

Human corrective feedback is a\ncrucial form of guidance to enable such generalization. However, adapting to\nand learning from online human corrections is a non-trivial endeavor: not only\ndo robots need to remember human feedback over time to retrieve the right\ninformation in new settings and reduce the intervention rate, but also they\nwould need to be able to respond to feedback that can be arbitrary corrections\nabout high-level human preferences to low-level adjustments to skill\nparameters. In this work, we present Distillation and Retrieval of Online\nCorrections (DROC), a large language model (LLM)-based system that can respond\nto arbitrary forms of language feedback, distill generalizable knowledge from\ncorrections, and retrieve relevant past experiences based on textual and visual\nsimilarity for improving performance in novel settings. DROC is able to respond\nto a sequence of online language corrections that address failures in both\nhigh-level task plans and low-level skill primitives.

One natural\nsolution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner\nwhere each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and\npreviously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering\nworks like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition.\nHowever, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps\nare independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single\nlinear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They\ndominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training\nMLPs compared to autoregressive networks.\n  In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion\nforecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a\nunified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible.\nHowever, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units\n-words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal\nand semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized\nattention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and\ndifferent position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding\nthe transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while\nadopting RoPE for temporal relativity.

The redundant DOF offers greater\nmanipulability of the arm configuration to avoid obstacles and singularities,\nbut it must be parameterized to fully specify the joint angles for a given end\neffector pose. For 7-DOF revolute (7R) manipulators, we introduce a new concept\nof generalized shoulder-elbow-wrist (SEW) angle, a generalization of the\nconventional SEW angle but with an arbitrary choice of the reference direction\nfunction. The SEW angle is widely used and easy for human operators to\nvisualize as a rotation of the elbow about the shoulder-wrist line. Since other\nredundancy parameterizations including the conventional SEW angle encounter an\nalgorithmic singularity along a line in the workspace, we introduce a special\nchoice of the reference direction function called the stereographic SEW angle\nwhich has a singularity only along a half-line, which can be placed out of\nreach.

These degradations typically\narise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient\nconditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous\nspecialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific\ntype of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant\nattention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model\nwithout requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However,\nthese methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the\ndistinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To\naddress this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network\nbased on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that different degradation types impact the image content on\ndifferent frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each\nrestoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency\ninformation from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra\nof the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by a\nbidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequency\ncomponents. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input\nfor a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achieves\nadaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbands\naccording to different input degradations.

Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the\npoint cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for\ncompression. To address this, we make use of the relations between the\nunorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual\ninformation for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context\n(HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces\na binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us\nto unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully\ndesigned context model. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian\ndistributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized\nattribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable\nhigh-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity\nrestoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to\neliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new reconstruction\nframework based on neural radiance field (NeRF), named ColonNeRF, which\nleverages neural rendering for novel view synthesis of long-sequence\ncolonoscopy.

Despite\nthese developments, generating images with unseen characteristics beneficial\nfor downstream tasks has received limited attention. To bridge this gap, we\npropose Style-Extracting Diffusion Models, featuring two conditioning\nmechanisms. Specifically, we utilize 1) a style conditioning mechanism which\nallows to inject style information of previously unseen images during image\ngeneration and 2) a content conditioning which can be targeted to a downstream\ntask, e.g., layout for segmentation. We introduce a trainable style encoder to\nextract style information from images, and an aggregation block that merges\nstyle information from multiple style inputs. This architecture enables the\ngeneration of images with unseen styles in a zero-shot manner, by leveraging\nstyles from unseen images, resulting in more diverse generations. In this work,\nwe use the image layout as target condition and first show the capability of\nour method on a natural image dataset as a proof-of-concept. We further\ndemonstrate its versatility in histopathology, where we combine prior knowledge\nabout tissue composition and unannotated data to create diverse synthetic\nimages with known layouts.

Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by\nperturbing inputs during training, which consequently mandates the retraining\nof the DPM. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of exposure bias in DPM\nand, intriguingly, we find that the exposure bias could be alleviated with a\nnovel sampling method that we propose, without retraining the model. We\nempirically and theoretically show that, during inference, for each backward\ntime step $t$ and corresponding state $\\hat{x}_t$, there might exist another\ntime step $t_s$ which exhibits superior coupling with $\\hat{x}_t$.

But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the\naccuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution\nkernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

Specifically, we propose a novel Class Free Prompt Learning (CFPL)\nparadigm for DG FAS, which utilizes two lightweight transformers, namely\nContent Q-Former (CQF) and Style Q-Former (SQF), to learn the different\nsemantic prompts conditioned on content and style features by using a set of\nlearnable query vectors, respectively. Thus, the generalizable prompt can be\nlearned by two improvements: (1) A Prompt-Text Matched (PTM) supervision is\nintroduced to ensure CQF learns visual representation that is most informative\nof the content description. (2) A Diversified Style Prompt (DSP) technology is\nproposed to diversify the learning of style prompts by mixing feature\nstatistics between instance-specific styles. Finally, the learned text features\nmodulate visual features to generalization through the designed Prompt\nModulation (PM). Extensive experiments show that the CFPL is effective and\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several cross-domain datasets.\n","authors":["Ajian Liu","Shuai Xue","Jianwen Gan","Jun Wan","Yanyan Liang","Jiankang Deng","Sergio Escalera","Zhen Lei"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14333v1.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 4 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14324v1","updated":"2024-03-21T11:44:25Z","published":"2024-03-21T11:44:25Z","title":"Neural Network-Based Processing and Reconstruction of Compromised\n  Biophotonic Image Data","summary":"  The integration of deep learning techniques with biophotonic setups has\nopened new horizons in bioimaging.

This approach also offers the prospect of simplifying hardware\nrequirements/complexities, thereby making advanced imaging standards more\naccessible in terms of cost and/or size. This article provides an in-depth\nreview of the diverse measurement aspects that researchers intentionally impair\nin their biophotonic setups, including the point spread function,\nsignal-to-noise ratio, sampling density, and pixel resolution.

Although effective, this paradigm is spatially inflexible, scales\npoorly to higher-resolution images, and lacks direct understanding of object\nshapes. To address these limitations, some recent works utilized implicit\nneural representations (INRs) to learn continuous representations for\nsegmentation. However, these methods often directly adopted components designed\nfor 3D shape reconstruction. More importantly, these formulations were also\nconstrained to either point-based or global contexts, lacking contextual\nunderstanding or local fine-grained details, respectively--both critical for\naccurate segmentation.

This is because current video diffusion models often attempt to\nprocess high-dimensional videos directly. To tackle this issue, we propose\ncontent-motion latent diffusion model (CMD), a novel efficient extension of\npretrained image diffusion models for video generation. Specifically, we\npropose an autoencoder that succinctly encodes a video as a combination of a\ncontent frame (like an image) and a low-dimensional motion latent\nrepresentation. The former represents the common content, and the latter\nrepresents the underlying motion in the video, respectively. We generate the\ncontent frame by fine-tuning a pretrained image diffusion model, and we\ngenerate the motion latent representation by training a new lightweight\ndiffusion model. A key innovation here is the design of a compact latent space\nthat can directly utilizes a pretrained image diffusion model, which has not\nbeen done in previous latent video diffusion models. This leads to considerably\nbetter quality generation and reduced computational costs. For instance, CMD\ncan sample a video 7.7$\\times$ faster than prior approaches by generating a\nvideo of 512$\\times$1024 resolution and length 16 in 3.1 seconds.

Therefore, safeguarding face\nrecognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing\nlearning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding\ndetection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer\nsignificant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies\nseek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the\npresentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these\nmethods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth\nand infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity\nmobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when\neither modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an\naccurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to\novercome the issues above. The primary innovation of this work lies in the\nfollowing aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and\nauditory modalities using three commonly available sensors: camera, speaker,\nand microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three\nhierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion;\n(3).

One natural\nsolution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner\nwhere each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and\npreviously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering\nworks like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition.\nHowever, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps\nare independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single\nlinear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously.

In the real world, however, the environments that the\nimages are taken from change over time. This causes a distribution shift\nbetween training and testing and degrades the performance of re-id. To maintain\nre-id performance, models should continue adapting to the test environment's\ntemporal changes. Test-time adaptation (TTA), which aims to adapt models to the\ntest environment with only unlabeled test data, is a promising way to handle\nthis problem because TTA can adapt models instantly in the test environment.\nHowever, the previous TTA methods are designed for classification and cannot be\ndirectly applied to re-id. This is because the set of people's identities in\nthe dataset differs between training and testing in re-id, whereas the set of\nclasses is fixed in the current TTA methods designed for classification.

Thus, IID models employing only a single\nimage during inference while keeping as high IID quality as the one with an\nimage plus LiDAR intensity are highly desired. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel approach that utilizes only an image during inference while\nutilizing an image and LiDAR intensity during training.

We propose\nfirst extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building\nand refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around\nthe mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the\nsurface, such as hair or grass.

With the guidance of a background mask, we devise a bidirectional\ncross-attention-based spatial fusion strategy to facilitate comprehensive\nspatial interaction between the background information of the camera BEV\nfeature and the radar BEV feature. As the first camera-radar fusion-based place\nrecognition network, CRPlace has been evaluated thoroughly on the nuScenes\ndataset. The results show that our algorithm outperforms a variety of baseline\nmethods across a comprehensive set of metrics (recall@1 reaches 91.2%).\n","authors":["Shaowei Fu","Yifan Duan","Yao Li","Chengzhen Meng","Yingjie Wang","Jianmin Ji","Yanyong Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15183v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15171v1","updated":"2024-03-22T12:48:00Z","published":"2024-03-22T12:48:00Z","title":"AV-Occupant Perceived Risk Model for Cut-In Scenarios with Empirical\n  Evaluation","summary":"  Advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies necessitate precise\nestimation of perceived risk to enhance user comfort, acceptance and trust.\nThis paper introduces a novel AV-Occupant Risk (AVOR) model designed for\nperceived risk estimation during AV cut-in scenarios.

Despite its widespread adoption, a\nsignificant limitation of CLIP lies in the inadequate length of text input. The\nlength of the text token is restricted to 77, and an empirical study shows the\nactual effective length is even less than 20. This prevents CLIP from handling\ndetailed descriptions, limiting its applications for image retrieval and\ntext-to-image generation with extensive prerequisites. To this end, we propose\nLong-CLIP as a plug-and-play alternative to CLIP that supports long-text input,\nretains or even surpasses its zero-shot generalizability, and aligns the CLIP\nlatent space, making it readily replace CLIP without any further adaptation in\ndownstream frameworks. Nevertheless, achieving this goal is far from\nstraightforward, as simplistic fine-tuning can result in a significant\ndegradation of CLIP's performance. Moreover, substituting the text encoder with\na language model supporting longer contexts necessitates pretraining with vast\namounts of data, incurring significant expenses. Accordingly, Long-CLIP\nintroduces an efficient fine-tuning solution on CLIP with two novel strategies\ndesigned to maintain the original capabilities, including (1) a\nknowledge-preserved stretching of positional embedding and (2) a primary\ncomponent matching of CLIP features. With leveraging just one million extra\nlong text-image pairs, Long-CLIP has shown the superiority to CLIP for about\n20% in long caption text-image retrieval and 6% in traditional text-image\nretrieval tasks, e.g., COCO and Flickr30k.

However, training vision transformers for high-resolution\npixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to\nhierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on\nlow-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural\nchoices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions\nsignificantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and\nslow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for\nefficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The\nkey principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during\ntraining, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local\ninteractions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between\ntokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the\nhigh-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this\nstrategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary\nembeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and\nit is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches.

In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of\nVLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We\nfind that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated\nby maximizing the length of generated sequences.

In applications such\nas autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are\nusually passed through a \"virtual sensor\" realized by a deep learning model, to\nproduce \"measurements\" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a\ntracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are\naccumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We\nargue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information,\nand therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal\ninformation, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the\nend of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called\nMULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object,\na pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the\ninput buffer. This is achieved with fairly straightforward changes in commonly\nused lidar detection models, and with only marginal extra processing, but the\nresulting symmetry is satisfying. Such paired detections make it possible not\nonly to construct rudimentary trackers fairly easily, but also to construct\nmore sophisticated trackers that can exploit the extra information conveyed by\nthe pair and be robust to choices of motion models and object birth/death\nmodels.

However, its direct adaption in medical image\nsegmentation tasks shows significant performance drops with inferior accuracy\nand unstable results. It may also requires an excessive number of prompt points\nto obtain a reasonable accuracy. For segmenting 3D radiological CT or MRI\nscans, a 2D SAM model has to separately handle hundreds of 2D slices. Although\nquite a few studies explore adapting SAM into medical image volumes, the\nefficiency of 2D adaption methods is unsatisfactory and 3D adaptation methods\nonly capable of segmenting specific organs/tumors.

Instead of adapting SAM, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation\nmodel using a (nearly) fully labeled CT dataset. To train CT-SAM3D effectively,\nensuring the model's accurate responses to higher-dimensional spatial prompts\nis crucial, and 3D patch-wise training is required due to GPU memory\nconstraints.

To address this limitation, we present the Continual\nVision-and-Language Navigation (CVLN) paradigm, designed to evaluate agents\ntrained through a continual learning process. For the training and evaluation\nof CVLN agents, we re-arrange existing VLN datasets to propose two datasets:\nCVLN-I, focused on navigation via initial-instruction interpretation, and\nCVLN-D, aimed at navigation through dialogue with other agents. Furthermore, we\npropose two novel rehearsal-based methods for CVLN, Perplexity Replay (PerpR)\nand Episodic Self-Replay (ESR). PerpR prioritizes replaying challenging\nepisodes based on action perplexity, while ESR replays previously predicted\naction logits to preserve learned behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed methods on CVLN through extensive experiments.\n","authors":["Seongjun Jeong","Gi-Cheon Kang","Seongho Choi","Joochan Kim","Byoung-Tak Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15049v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15048v1","updated":"2024-03-22T09:13:09Z","published":"2024-03-22T09:13:09Z","title":"Cartoon Hallucinations Detection: Pose-aware In Context Visual Learning","summary":"  Large-scale Text-to-Image (TTI) models have become a common approach for\ngenerating training data in various generative fields.

Furthermore,\nmany practical real-world situations involve a moving camera that continuously\nobserves its surroundings, and the temporal information of the input video\nstreams is simply overlooked by single-view methods. We propose a novel\nsolution that makes use of RGB video streams.

The SLAM module utilizes a\nvideo stream and additional scale-sensitive readings to estimate camera poses\nand metric depth. The object pose predictor then generates canonical object\nrepresentations from RGB images. The object pose is estimated through geometric\nregistration of these canonical object representations with estimated object\ndepth points. All per-view estimates finally undergo optimization within a pose\ngraph, culminating in the output of robust and accurate canonical object poses.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that when utilizing public dataset\nsequences with high-quality depth information, the proposed method exhibits\ncomparable performance to state-of-the-art RGB-D methods.

For\nexample, if the images labeled as mustache consist solely of male figures, the\nmodel may inadvertently learn to classify images by gender rather than the\npresence of a mustache. One approach to mitigate such biases is to direct the\nmodel's attention toward the target object's location, usually marked using\nbounding boxes or polygons for annotation. However, collecting such annotations\nrequires substantial time and human effort. Therefore, we propose a novel\npatch-labeling method that integrates AI assistance with crowdsourcing to\ncapture human attention from images, which can be a viable solution for\nmitigating bias.

(2) We\ndesign TPV Fusion to update the 2D TPV features through recurrent 2D-3D-2D\naggregation, where a Distance-Aware Spherical Convolution (DASC) is applied.\n(3) By adaptively choosing TPV affinitive neighbors, the newly proposed\nGeometric Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) further improves the geometric\nconsistency. As a result, our TPVD outperforms existing methods on KITTI,\nNYUv2, and SUN RGBD. Furthermore, we build a novel depth completion dataset\nnamed TOFDC, which is acquired by the time-of-flight (TOF) sensor and the color\ncamera on smartphones.

The goal is\nto synthesize an image depicting an action in the user's context (i.e., action\nframe) by conditioning on a user prompt and an input egocentric image. Notably,\nexisting egocentric action datasets lack the detailed annotations that describe\nthe execution of actions. Additionally, existing diffusion-based image\nmanipulation models are sub-optimal in controlling the state transition of an\naction in egocentric image pixel space because of the domain gap. To this end,\nwe propose to Learn EGOcentric (LEGO) action frame generation via visual\ninstruction tuning. First, we introduce a prompt enhancement scheme to generate\nenriched action descriptions from a visual large language model (VLLM) by\nvisual instruction tuning. Then we propose a novel method to leverage image and\ntext embeddings from the VLLM as additional conditioning to improve the\nperformance of a diffusion model. We validate our model on two egocentric\ndatasets -- Ego4D and Epic-Kitchens. Our experiments show substantial\nimprovement over prior image manipulation models in both quantitative and\nqualitative evaluation. We also conduct detailed ablation studies and analysis\nto provide insights in our method.

However, current techniques\nfor evaluating performance on unseen data require expensive and time-intensive\nlabels.\n  $\\textbf{Methods}$: We use a \"Masked Siamese Network\" (MSN) to identify novel\nphenomena in unseen data and predict polyp detector performance. MSN is trained\nto predict masked out regions of polyp images, without any labels. We test\nMSN's ability to be trained on data only from Israel and detect unseen\ntechniques, narrow-band imaging (NBI) and chromendoscoy (CE), on colonoscopes\nfrom Japan (354 videos, 128 hours). We also test MSN's ability to predict\nperformance of Computer Aided Detection (CADe) of polyps on colonoscopies from\nboth countries, even though MSN is not trained on data from Japan.\n  $\\textbf{Results}$: MSN correctly identifies NBI and CE as less similar to\nIsrael whitelight than Japan whitelight (bootstrapped z-test, |z| > 496, p <\n10^-8 for both) using the label-free Frechet distance. MSN detects NBI with 99%\naccuracy, predicts CE better than our heuristic (90% vs 79% accuracy) despite\nbeing trained only on whitelight, and is the only method that is robust to\nnoisy labels. MSN predicts CADe polyp detector performance on in-domain Israel\nand out-of-domain Japan colonoscopies (r=0.79, 0.37 respectively). With few\nexamples of Japan detector performance to train on, MSN prediction of Japan\nperformance improves (r=0.56).\n  $\\textbf{Conclusion}$: Our technique can identify distribution shifts in\nclinical data and can predict CADe detector performance on unseen data, without\nlabels. Our self-supervised approach can aid in detecting when data in practice\nis different from training, such as between hospitals or data has meaningfully\nshifted from training.

Traditional methods\nhave been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet\nthe wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel\ntraining-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary\nsteps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.\nInstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an\nexisting image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion\nand feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.\nBeyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support\nnovel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,\nsubject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by\nprevious methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature\ninjection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source\nvideo. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the\nprevious best approach by 35\\% on prompt alignment, and 25\\% on human\npreference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high\nsuccess rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to\nseamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods.

Recent advancements suggest that data-driven methods are\nhighly effective for front-end tasks, while geometry-based methods continue to\nbe essential in the back-end processes. However, such a decoupled paradigm\nbetween the data-driven front-end and geometry-based back-end can lead to\nsub-optimal performance, consequently reducing the system's capabilities and\ngeneralization potential. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel\nself-supervised imperative learning framework, named imperative SLAM (iSLAM),\nwhich fosters reciprocal correction between the front-end and back-end, thus\nenhancing performance without necessitating any external supervision.\nSpecifically, we formulate the SLAM problem as a bilevel optimization so that\nthe front-end and back-end are bidirectionally connected. As a result, the\nfront-end model can learn global geometric knowledge obtained through pose\ngraph optimization by back-propagating the residuals from the back-end\ncomponent. We showcase the effectiveness of this new framework through an\napplication of stereo-inertial SLAM.

In this paper, we propose a novel Noisy Layer Generation\nmethod (NAYER) which relocates the random source from the input to a noisy\nlayer and utilizes the meaningful constant label-text embedding (LTE) as the\ninput.

Recently, the need to apply face re-aging to\nnon-photorealistic images, like comics, illustrations, and animations, has\nemerged as an extension in various entertainment sectors. However, the lack of\na network that can seamlessly edit the apparent age in NPR images has limited\nthese tasks to a naive, sequential approach. This often results in unpleasant\nartifacts and a loss of facial attributes due to domain discrepancies. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with\nportrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage\nexisting face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the\nsame PR domain. Our method uniquely fuses distinct latent vectors, each\nresponsible for managing aging-related attributes and NPR appearance. By\nadopting an exemplar-based approach, our method offers greater flexibility\ncompared to domain-level fine-tuning approaches, which typically require\nseparate training or fine-tuning for each domain. This effectively addresses\nthe limitation of requiring paired datasets for re-aging and domain-level,\ndata-driven approaches for stylization. Our experiments show that our model can\neffortlessly generate re-aged images while simultaneously transferring the\nstyle of examples, maintaining both natural appearance and controllability.\n","authors":["Bumsoo Kim","Abdul Muqeet","Kyuchul Lee","Sanghyun Seo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02733v3.pdf","comment":"14 pages, 15 figures, 1 table"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07840v2","updated":"2024-03-22T07:27:29Z","published":"2018-08-23T16:55:53Z","title":"Learning to Importance Sample in Primary Sample Space","summary":"  Importance sampling is one of the most widely used variance reduction\nstrategies in Monte Carlo rendering. In this paper, we propose a novel\nimportance sampling technique that uses a neural network to learn how to sample\nfrom a desired density represented by a set of samples. Our approach considers\nan existing Monte Carlo rendering algorithm as a black box. During a\nscene-dependent training phase, we learn to generate samples with a desired\ndensity in the primary sample space of the rendering algorithm using maximum\nlikelihood estimation. We leverage a recent neural network architecture that\nwas designed to represent real-valued non-volume preserving ('Real NVP')\ntransformations in high dimensional spaces. We use Real NVP to non-linearly\nwarp primary sample space and obtain desired densities. In addition, Real NVP\nefficiently computes the determinant of the Jacobian of the warp, which is\nrequired to implement the change of integration variables implied by the warp.\nA main advantage of our approach is that it is agnostic of underlying light\ntransport effects, and can be combined with many existing rendering techniques\nby treating them as a black box.

As a result, when deployed in new domains, the\ndetectors would have a significant performance degradation due to domain\ndiscrepancy. In this paper, we study the problem of cross-domain MAV detection.\nThe contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) We propose a\nMulti-MAV-Multi-Domain (M3D) dataset consisting of both simulation and\nrealistic images. Compared to other existing datasets, the proposed one is more\ncomprehensive in the sense that it covers rich scenes, diverse MAV types, and\nvarious viewing angles. A new benchmark for cross-domain MAV detection is\nproposed based on the proposed dataset. 2) We propose a Noise Suppression\nNetwork (NSN) based on the framework of pseudo-labeling and a large-to-small\ntraining procedure. To reduce the challenging pseudo-label noises, two novel\nmodules are designed in this network. The first is a prior-based curriculum\nlearning module for allocating adaptive thresholds for pseudo labels with\ndifferent difficulties. The second is a masked copy-paste augmentation module\nfor pasting truly-labeled MAVs on unlabeled target images and thus decreasing\npseudo-label noises. 3) Extensive experimental results verify the superior\nperformance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art ones.

Apart from sharing of\nawareness and perception information over wireless communication links,\ncooperative maneuver planning may facilitate active guidance of connected\nautomated vehicles at urban intersections. Research in automatic intersection\nmanagement put forth a large body of works that mostly employ rule-based or\noptimization-based approaches primarily in fully automated simulated\nenvironments. In this work, we present two cooperative planning approaches that\nare capable of handling mixed traffic, i.e., the road being shared by automated\nvehicles and regular vehicles driven by humans. Firstly, we propose an\noptimization-based planner trained on real driving data that cyclically selects\nthe most efficient out of multiple predicted coordinated maneuvers.\nAdditionally, we present a cooperative planning approach based on graph-based\nreinforcement learning, which conquers the lack of ground truth data for\ncooperative maneuvers. We present evaluation results of both cooperative\nplanners in high-fidelity simulation and real-world traffic. Simulative\nexperiments in fully automated traffic and mixed traffic show that cooperative\nmaneuver planning leads to less delay due to interaction and a reduced number\nof stops. In real-world experiments with three prototype connected automated\nvehicles in public traffic, both planners demonstrate their ability to perform\nefficient cooperative maneuvers.\n","authors":["Marvin Klimke","Max Bastian Mertens","Benjamin V√∂lz","Michael Buchholz"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16478v1.pdf","comment":"M.

The relevance between the pretraining pretext and target\ntasks is crucial to the success of transfer learning. Various pretext tasks\nhave been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three\ndimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic\nones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data\nwith anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance\nimaging views. As these imaging planes are defined according to the anatomy of\nthe imaged organ, pretext tasks effectively exploiting this information can\npretrain the networks to gain knowledge on the organ of interest. In this work,\nwe propose two complementary pretext tasks for this group of medical image data\nbased on the spatial relationship of the imaging planes. The first is to learn\nthe relative orientation between the imaging planes and implemented as\nregressing their intersecting lines. The second exploits parallel imaging\nplanes to regress their relative slice locations within a stack.

To reduce costs in practice, low-cost multi-view cameras for 3D object\ndetection are proposed to replace the expansive LiDAR sensors. However, relying\nsolely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object\ndetection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras\nwith the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable\nmulti-modal 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce RCBEVDet, a\nradar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV).\nSpecifically, we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction.\nRadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section\n(RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone, a point-based\nencoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features,\nwith an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the\ntwo encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to\nscattering the point feature in BEV. Besides, we present the Cross-Attention\nMulti-layer Fusion module to automatically align the multi-modal BEV feature\nfrom radar and camera with the deformable attention mechanism, and then fuse\nthe feature with channel and spatial fusion layers. Experimental results show\nthat RCBEVDet achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results on\nnuScenes and view-of-delft (VoD) 3D object detection benchmarks. Furthermore,\nRCBEVDet achieves better 3D detection results than all real-time camera-only\nand radar-camera 3D object detectors with a faster inference speed at 21~28\nFPS.

To address this key shortcoming, we propose a\nnovel distance-geometric robot representation coupled with a graph structure\nthat allows us to leverage the sample efficiency of Euclidean equivariant\nfunctions and the generalizability of graph neural networks (GNNs). Our\napproach is generative graphical inverse kinematics (GGIK), the first learned\nIK solver able to accurately and efficiently produce a large number of diverse\nsolutions in parallel while also displaying the ability to generalize -- a\nsingle learned model can be used to produce IK solutions for a variety of\ndifferent robots. When compared to several other learned IK methods, GGIK\nprovides more accurate solutions with the same amount of data. GGIK can\ngeneralize reasonably well to robot manipulators unseen during training.\nAdditionally, GGIK can learn a constrained distribution that encodes joint\nlimits and scales efficiently to larger robots and a high number of sampled\nsolutions. Finally, GGIK can be used to complement local IK solvers by\nproviding reliable initializations for a local optimization process.\n","authors":["Oliver Limoyo","Filip Mariƒá","Matthew Giamou","Petra Alexson","Ivan Petroviƒá","Jonathan Kelly"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08812v4.pdf","comment":"Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics, June 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16262v1","updated":"2024-03-24T18:49:16Z","published":"2024-03-24T18:49:16Z","title":"HT-LIP Model based Robust Control of Quadrupedal Robot Locomotion under\n  Unknown Vertical Ground Motion","summary":"  This paper presents a hierarchical control framework that enables robust\nquadrupedal locomotion on a dynamic rigid surface (DRS) with general and\nunknown vertical motions.

We further assume that the learner's visual system\nwill monitor the changing arrangements of objects in the scene and will learn\nto predict the effects of each action by comparing perception with a\nsupervisory signal from the motor system. We model perception using standard\ndeep networks for feature extraction and classification, and gradient descent\nlearning. Our main finding is that, from learning the task of action\nprediction, an unexpected image representation emerges exhibiting regularities\nthat foreshadow the perception and representation of numbers and quantity.\nThese include distinct categories for zero and the first few natural numbers, a\nstrict ordering of the numbers, and a one-dimensional signal that correlates\nwith numerical quantity.

The vast majority of modern MAPF solvers\nfocus on improving CBS by reducing the size of this tree through various\nstrategies with few methods modifying the low level planner. Typically low\nlevel planners in existing CBS methods use an unweighted cost-to-go heuristic,\nwith suboptimal CBS methods also using a conflict heuristic to help the high\nlevel search. In this paper, we show that, contrary to prevailing CBS beliefs,\na weighted cost-to-go heuristic can be used effectively alongside the conflict\nheuristic in two possible variants. In particular, one of these variants can\nobtain large speedups, 2-100x, across several scenarios and suboptimal CBS\nmethods. Importantly, we discover that performance is related not to the\nweighted cost-to-go heuristic but rather to the relative conflict heuristic\nweight's ability to effectively balance low-level and high-level work.\nAdditionally, to the best of our knowledge, we show the first theoretical\nrelation of prioritized planning and bounded suboptimal CBS and demonstrate\nthat our methods are their natural generalization.

Recent work on reconstructing\nand statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being\ntopologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D\nrepresentation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin,\nopen, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for\nreconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material\nand lighting or unconditional generative modelling.

In response to\nthese limitations, the concept of distilling the information on a dataset into\na condensed set of (synthetic) samples, namely a distilled dataset, emerged.\nOne crucial aspect is the selected architecture (usually ConvNet) for linking\nthe original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if\nthe employed model architecture differs from the model used during\ndistillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images,\ne.g., 128x128 and higher.

These attacks subtly embed\nmalicious behaviors within the model during training, which can be activated by\nspecific triggers in the inference phase, posing significant security risks.\nDespite existing countermeasures through fine-tuning that reduce the adverse\nimpacts of such attacks, these defenses often degrade the clean accuracy and\nnecessitate the construction of extensive clean training pairs.

A prime exemplification is\nthe recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language\nmodels such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to\nimprove accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial\naspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration\nmethods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical\nfor test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during\ntest-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP.

It is essential that\nrobots can exhibit robust perception and manipulation skills for articulated\nobjects in real-world robotic applications. However, existing methods for\narticulated objects insufficiently address noise in point clouds and struggle\nto bridge the gap between simulation and reality, thus limiting the practical\ndeployment in real-world scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nframework towards Robust Perception and Manipulation for Articulated Objects\n(RPMArt), which learns to estimate the articulation parameters and manipulate\nthe articulation part from the noisy point cloud. Our primary contribution is a\nRobust Articulation Network (RoArtNet) that is able to predict both joint\nparameters and affordable points robustly by local feature learning and point\ntuple voting. Moreover, we introduce an articulation-aware classification\nscheme to enhance its ability for sim-to-real transfer. Finally, with the\nestimated affordable point and articulation joint constraint, the robot can\ngenerate robust actions to manipulate articulated objects. After learning only\nfrom synthetic data, RPMArt is able to transfer zero-shot to real-world\narticulated objects.

We desire the trained policy to ensure that the agent satisfies\nspecific task objectives, expressed in discrete-time Signal Temporal Logic\n(DT-STL). One advantage for reformulation of a task via formal frameworks, like\nDT-STL, is that it permits quantitative satisfaction semantics. In other words,\ngiven a trajectory and a DT-STL formula, we can compute the robustness, which\ncan be interpreted as an approximate signed distance between the trajectory and\nthe set of trajectories satisfying the formula. We utilize feedback\ncontrollers, and we assume a feed forward neural network for learning these\nfeedback controllers. We show how this learning problem is similar to training\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the number of recurrent units is\nproportional to the temporal horizon of the agent's task objectives. This poses\na challenge: RNNs are susceptible to vanishing and exploding gradients, and\nna\\\"{i}ve gradient descent-based strategies to solve long-horizon task\nobjectives thus suffer from the same problems. To tackle this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel gradient approximation algorithm based on the idea of dropout\nor gradient sampling. We show that, the existing smooth semantics for\nrobustness are inefficient regarding gradient computation when the\nspecification becomes complex. To address this challenge, we propose a new\nsmooth semantics for DT-STL that under-approximates the robustness value and\nscales well for backpropagation over a complex specification.

To process the asynchronous temporal event streams\nfrom such sensors, recent research has shown that a mix of Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs), Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as well as hybrid SNN-ANN\nalgorithms are necessary to achieve high accuracies across a range of\nperception tasks.

This is\ndue to the mismatch between the irregular nature of event streams and diverse\ncharacteristics of algorithms on the one hand and the underlying hardware\nplatform on the other. We propose Ev-Edge, a framework that contains three key\noptimizations to boost the performance of event-based vision systems on edge\nplatforms: (1) An Event2Sparse Frame converter directly transforms raw event\nstreams into sparse frames, enabling the use of sparse libraries with minimal\nencoding overheads (2) A Dynamic Sparse Frame Aggregator merges sparse frames\nat runtime by trading off the temporal granularity of events and computational\ndemand thereby improving hardware utilization (3) A Network Mapper maps\nconcurrently executing tasks to different processing elements while also\nselecting layer precision by considering both compute and communication\noverheads.

Source-free domain adaptation, as a more\npractical technique, addresses the concerns of data privacy and storage\nlimitations in typical unsupervised domain adaptation methods, making it\nespecially relevant in the context of intelligent vehicles. It utilizes a\nwell-trained source model and unlabeled target data to achieve adaptation in\nthe target domain.

In this paper, we propose\nan end-to-end source-free domain adaptation semantic segmentation method via\nImportance-Aware and Prototype-Contrast (IAPC) learning. The proposed IAPC\nframework effectively extracts domain-invariant knowledge from the well-trained\nsource model and learns domain-specific knowledge from the unlabeled target\ndomain. Specifically, considering the problem of domain shift in the prediction\nof the target domain by the source model, we put forward an importance-aware\nmechanism for the biased target prediction probability distribution to extract\ndomain-invariant knowledge from the source model.

Incorporated into our design is the unique capability to\ntolerate realistic V2X bandwidth limitations and transmission delays, while\ndealing with bulky perception representations. We also propose a prediction\naggregation module, which unifies the predictions obtained by different CAVs\nand generates the final prediction. Through extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cooperative\nperception, tracking, and motion prediction tasks.

To address these issues, we propose an\nefficient change detection framework, ELGC-Net, which leverages rich contextual\ninformation to precisely estimate change regions while reducing the model size.\nOur ELGC-Net comprises a Siamese encoder, fusion modules, and a decoder. The\nfocus of our design is the introduction of an Efficient Local-Global Context\nAggregator module within the encoder, capturing enhanced global context and\nlocal spatial information through a novel pooled-transpose (PT) attention and\ndepthwise convolution, respectively. The PT attention employs pooling\noperations for robust feature extraction and minimizes computational cost with\ntransposed attention.

Concretely, our\napproach introduces discrete representation learning based on a latent vector\ninstead of volumetric grids, which not only reduces computational costs but\nalso preserves essential geometric details by learning the joint distributions\nin a more tractable order. The capacity of conditional generation can thus be\nrealized by simply concatenating various conditioning inputs to the latent\nvector, such as point clouds, categories, images, and texts. In addition,\nthanks to the simplicity of our model architecture, we naturally scale up our\napproach to a larger model with an impressive 3.6 billion parameters, further\nenhancing the quality of versatile 3D generation. Extensive experiments on four\ngeneration tasks demonstrate that Argus3D can synthesize diverse and faithful\nshapes across multiple categories, achieving remarkable performance.\n","authors":["Xuelin Qian","Yu Wang","Simian Luo","Yinda Zhang","Ying Tai","Zhenyu Zhang","Chengjie Wang","Xiangyang Xue","Bo Zhao","Tiejun Huang","Yunsheng Wu","Yanwei Fu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12225v2.pdf","comment":"Project page: https://argus-3d.github.io/ .

Traditional\nmethods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution,\nimplying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the\ncopyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by\n\"cooking\" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models\nthat perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment\nphase, the original test data must be also \"cooked\" through DataCook to ensure\nnormal model performance. This process grants copyright holders control over\nauthorization during the deployment phase. The mechanism behind DataCook is by\ncrafting anti-adversarial examples (AntiAdv), which are designed to enhance\nmodel confidence, as opposed to standard adversarial examples (Adv) that aim to\nconfuse models.

We\nconducted extensive experiments on MedMNIST datasets, encompassing both 2D/3D\ndata and the high-resolution variants. The outcomes indicate that DataCook\neffectively meets its objectives, preventing models trained on AntiAdv from\nanalyzing unauthorized data effectively, without compromising the validity and\naccuracy of the data in legitimate scenarios.

However, we identify two key\nlimitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based\nVRD models, which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction.\nUnder the conventional assignment, an unspecialized query is trained since a\nquery is expected to detect every relation, which makes it difficult for a\nquery to specialize in specific relations. Furthermore, a query is also\ninsufficiently trained since a GT is assigned only to a single prediction,\ntherefore near-correct or even correct predictions are suppressed by being\nassigned no relation as a GT. To address these issues, we propose Groupwise\nQuery Specialization and Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment (SpeaQ). Groupwise\nQuery Specialization trains a specialized query by dividing queries and\nrelations into disjoint groups and directing a query in a specific query group\nsolely toward relations in the corresponding relation group. Quality-Aware\nMulti-Assignment further facilitates the training by assigning a GT to multiple\npredictions that are significantly close to a GT in terms of a subject, an\nobject, and the relation in between.

The\nlight transport condition plays an important role in this task since changing\nthe conditions will lead to different imaging models. Existing learning-based\nNLOS methods usually train independent models for different light transport\nconditions, which is computationally inefficient and impairs the practicality\nof the models. In this work, we propose NLOS-LTM, a novel passive NLOS imaging\nmethod that effectively handles multiple light transport conditions with a\nsingle network. We achieve this by inferring a latent light transport\nrepresentation from the projection image and using this representation to\nmodulate the network that reconstructs the hidden image from the projection\nimage. We train a light transport encoder together with a vector quantizer to\nobtain the light transport representation. To further regulate this\nrepresentation, we jointly learn both the reconstruction network and the\nreprojection network during training. A set of light transport modulation\nblocks is used to modulate the two jointly trained networks in a multi-scale\nway. Extensive experiments on a large-scale passive NLOS dataset demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed method.

Existing methods adhering to this constraint\nare prone to catastrophic forgetting, far more so than replay-based techniques\nthat retain access to past samples. In this paper, to solve the exemplar-free\nCIL problem, we propose a Dual-Stream Analytic Learning (DS-AL) approach. The\nDS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear\nsolution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting\nlimitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL\nproblem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an\nequivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The\ncompensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.\nThis module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function\nfrom the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the\nembedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that the DS-AL, despite being an exemplar-free technique,\ndelivers performance comparable with or better than that of replay-based\nmethods across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and\nImageNet-Full.

However, there is a problem of degrading accuracy\nwhen the data distribution shifts between training and testing. As a solution\nof this problem, Test-time Adaptation~(TTA) has been well studied because of\nits practicality. Although TTA methods increase accuracy under distribution\nshift by updating the model at test time, using high-uncertainty predictions is\nknown to degrade accuracy. Since the input image is the root of the\ndistribution shift, we incorporate a new perspective on enhancing the input\nimage into TTA methods to reduce the prediction's uncertainty. We hypothesize\nthat enhancing the input image reduces prediction's uncertainty and increase\nthe accuracy of TTA methods. On the basis of our hypothesis, we propose a novel\nmethod: Test-time Enhancer and Classifier Adaptation~(TECA). In TECA, the\nclassification model is combined with the image enhancement model that\ntransforms input images into recognition-friendly ones, and these models are\nupdated by existing TTA methods. Furthermore, we found that the prediction from\nthe enhanced image does not always have lower uncertainty than the prediction\nfrom the original image. Thus, we propose logit switching, which compares the\nuncertainty measure of these predictions and outputs the lower one.

Specifically, CoDA consists of a\nChain-of-Domain (CoD) strategy and a Severity-Aware Visual Prompt Tuning\n(SAVPT) mechanism. CoD focuses on scene-level instructions to divide all\nadverse scenes into easy and hard scenes, guiding models to adapt from source\nto easy domains with easy scene images, and then to hard domains with hard\nscene images, thereby laying a solid foundation for whole adaptations. Building\nupon this foundation, we employ SAVPT to dive into more detailed image-level\ninstructions to boost performance.

Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various\nscenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when\ndealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different\ndevices and the manual operation of the transducer.

Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based\non natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant\nGPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method\ntailored specifically for ultrasound applications.

Our\napproach, namely Visual Whole-Body Control(VBC), is composed of a low-level\npolicy using all degrees of freedom to track the end-effector manipulator\nposition and a high-level policy proposing the end-effector position based on\nvisual inputs. We train both levels of policies in simulation and perform\nSim2Real transfer for real robot deployment. We perform extensive experiments\nand show significant improvements over baselines in picking up diverse objects\nin different configurations (heights, locations, orientations) and\nenvironments.

In\nresponse to this issue, we propose a novel swarm navigation algorithm\naddressing these challenges. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated\nthrough an experimental validation in which a cyborg swarm was successfully\nnavigated through an unknown sandy field with obstacles and hills.

The PF-DDQN method leverages the imprecise weight values of the\nnetwork as state values to formulate the state space equation. Through the\niterative fusion process of neural networks and particle filters, the DDQN\nmodel is optimized to acquire the optimal true weight values, thus enhancing\nthe algorithm's efficiency. The proposed method's effectiveness and superiority\nare validated through numerical simulations. Overall, the simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses the traditional DDQN\nalgorithm in terms of path planning superiority and training time indicators by\n92.62% and 76.88%, respectively. In conclusion, the PF-DDQN method addresses\nthe challenges encountered by RL planning algorithms in AGV path planning.

In this work, we consider decision-making and probabilistic planning\nin stochastic systems modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs), given a\npartially ordered preference over a set of temporally extended goals.\nSpecifically, each temporally extended goal is expressed using a formula in\nLinear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces (LTL$_f$). To plan with the partially\nordered preference, we introduce order theory to map a preference over temporal\ngoals to a preference over policies for the MDP. Accordingly, a most preferred\npolicy under a stochastic ordering induces a stochastic nondominated\nprobability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. To synthesize a most\npreferred policy, our technical approach includes two key steps. In the first\nstep, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over\ntemporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which\nis a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the\nsecond step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to\ncomputing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed\nfrom the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic\nordering relation. Throughout the paper, we employ running examples to\nillustrate the proposed preference specification and solution approaches.

To address this problem, the\npixel-wise anomaly-detection approach has attracted increased research\nattention. Anomaly-detection techniques, such as uncertainty estimation and\nperceptual difference from reconstructed images, make it possible to identify\npixels of unknown objects as out-of-distribution (OoD) samples.

The main\nchallenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the\nsetting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,\nwhich have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and\ngeometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\\\"ively supervising\nthem on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view\ninputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and\nhigh-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or\neven a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance\nfield weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve\nas a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This\nprior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively\naddressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure\nof the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a\nprior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in\na pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes\nfeature learning more effective.

However, existing works often simplify this task within the\ncontext of shadow removal, limiting the light sources to one and\noversimplifying the scene, thus excluding complex self-shadows and restricting\nsurface classes to smooth ones. Although promising, such simplifications hinder\ngeneralizability to more realistic settings encountered in daily use. In this\npaper, we propose a new challenging task termed Ambient Lighting Normalization\n(ALN), which enables the study of interactions between shadows, unifying image\nrestoration and shadow removal in a broader context. To address the lack of\nappropriate datasets for ALN, we introduce the large-scale high-resolution\ndataset Ambient6K, comprising samples obtained from multiple light sources and\nincluding self-shadows resulting from complex geometries, which is the first of\nits kind.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19\nclassification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense\ntasks.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort.

Most\nmethods maintain consistent predictions of the unlabeled images under\nvariations (e.g., adding noise/perturbations, or creating alternative versions)\nin the image and/or model level. In most image-level variation, medical images\noften have prior structure information, which has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose novel dual structure-aware image filterings (DSAIF) as\nthe image-level variations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\nMotivated by connected filtering that simplifies image via filtering in\nstructure-aware tree-based image representation, we resort to the dual contrast\ninvariant Max-tree and Min-tree representation. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel connected filtering that removes topologically equivalent nodes (i.e.\nconnected components) having no siblings in the Max/Min-tree. This results in\ntwo filtered images preserving topologically critical structure. Applying the\nproposed DSAIF to mutually supervised networks decreases the consensus of their\nerroneous predictions on unlabeled images. This helps to alleviate the\nconfirmation bias issue of overfitting to noisy pseudo labels of unlabeled\nimages, and thus effectively improves the segmentation performance.

Specifically, our E4S performs face swapping in the latent space of a\npretrained StyleGAN, where a multi-scale mask-guided encoder is applied to\nproject the texture of each facial component into regional style codes and a\nmask-guided injection module manipulating feature maps with the style codes.\nBased on this disentanglement, face swapping can be simplified as style and\nmask swapping. Besides, due to the large lighting condition gap, transferring\nthe source skin into the target image may lead to disharmony lighting. We\npropose a re-coloring network to make the swapped face maintain the target\nlighting condition while preserving the source skin. Further, to deal with the\npotential mismatch areas during mask exchange, we design a face inpainting\nmodule to refine the face shape. The extensive comparisons with\nstate-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our E4S outperforms existing methods\nin preserving texture, shape, and lighting.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and\nself-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for\nthis task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains\nrich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in\nthe images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and\ngenerated images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and\nsemantic coherence separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in\nour experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout\nrestriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the\nimage synthesis process.

A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models\n(VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect\nadvanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has\nsurfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and\nLLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce\na simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is\nutilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a\nseries of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence\nof video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with\nthe spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a\nsingle composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The\nresulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while\nmaintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal\ninformation within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach\nenables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without\nnecessitating any video-data training.

Despite their\nadvancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias in the generated\ncontent, where the output is primarily influenced by the underlying Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) prior rather than the input image. Our empirical\nexperiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide\nconfident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent\nvisual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward\nvision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies. Firstly,\nfor tasks such as classification or multi-choice question-answering (QA), we\npropose a ``calibration'' step through affine transformation to adjust the\noutput distribution. This ``Post-Hoc debias'' approach ensures uniform scores\nfor each answer when the image is absent, serving as an effective\nregularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more\nintricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to ``Debias\nsampling'', drawing inspirations from contrastive decoding methods.\nFurthermore, our investigation sheds light on the instability of LVLMs across\nvarious decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different\nsettings, we significantly enhance performance, surpassing reported results and\nraising concerns about the fairness of existing evaluations.

It has become increasingly\nimportant in egocentric vision with its advantages in guiding agents to perform\ndaily tasks in complex environments. In this paper, we propose an interpretable\nand generalizable visual planning framework consisting of i) a novel\nSubstitution-based Concept Learner (SCL) that abstracts visual inputs into\ndisentangled concept representations, ii) symbol abstraction and reasoning that\nperforms task planning via the self-learned symbols, and iii) a Visual Causal\nTransition model (ViCT) that grounds visual causal transitions to semantically\nsimilar real-world actions. Given an initial state, we perform goal-conditioned\nvisual planning with a symbolic reasoning method fueled by the learned\nrepresentations and causal transitions to reach the goal state. To verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed model, we collect a large-scale visual planning\ndataset based on AI2-THOR, dubbed as CCTP. Extensive experiments on this\nchallenging dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method in\nvisual task planning.

They align the\ndistribution differences between domains as encoders without considering their\nunique characteristics. For instance, ViT excels in accuracy due to its\nsuperior ability to capture global representations, while CNN has an advantage\nin capturing local representations. This fact has led us to design a hybrid\nmethod to fully take advantage of both ViT and CNN, called Explicitly\nClass-specific Boundaries (ECB). ECB learns CNN on ViT to combine their\ndistinct strengths. In particular, we leverage ViT's properties to explicitly\nfind class-specific decision boundaries by maximizing the discrepancy between\nthe outputs of the two classifiers to detect target samples far from the source\nsupport. In contrast, the CNN encoder clusters target features based on the\npreviously defined class-specific boundaries by minimizing the discrepancy\nbetween the probabilities of the two classifiers. Finally, ViT and CNN mutually\nexchange knowledge to improve the quality of pseudo labels and reduce the\nknowledge discrepancies of these models.

While existing 3D hair modeling\nmethods have achieved impressive performance, the challenge of achieving\nhigh-quality hair reconstruction persists: they either require strict capture\nconditions, making practical applications difficult, or heavily rely on learned\nprior data, obscuring fine-grained details in images. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MonoHair,a generic framework to achieve high-fidelity\nhair reconstruction from a monocular video, without specific requirements for\nenvironments. Our approach bifurcates the hair modeling process into two main\nstages: precise exterior reconstruction and interior structure inference. The\nexterior is meticulously crafted using our Patch-based Multi-View Optimization\n(PMVO). This method strategically collects and integrates hair information from\nmultiple views, independent of prior data, to produce a high-fidelity exterior\n3D line map. This map not only captures intricate details but also facilitates\nthe inference of the hair's inner structure. For the interior, we employ a\ndata-driven, multi-view 3D hair reconstruction method. This method utilizes 2D\nstructural renderings derived from the reconstructed exterior, mirroring the\nsynthetic 2D inputs used during training. This alignment effectively bridges\nthe domain gap between our training data and real-world data, thereby enhancing\nthe accuracy and reliability of our interior structure inference. Lastly, we\ngenerate a strand model and resolve the directional ambiguity by our hair\ngrowth algorithm.

Recent studies have investigated various approaches to\noptimize the fusion of modality-specific features for enhancing joint\nrepresentations.

An adversarial attack can deceive the classifier\ninto making incorrect predictions by perturbing the input SAR images, for\nexample, with a few scatterers attached to the on-ground objects. Therefore, it\nis critical to develop robust SAR ATR systems that can detect potential\nadversarial attacks by leveraging the inherent uncertainty in ML classifiers,\nthereby effectively alerting human decision-makers. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel uncertainty-aware SAR ATR for detecting adversarial attacks.\nSpecifically, we leverage the capability of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) in\nperforming image classification with quantified epistemic uncertainty to\nmeasure the confidence for each input SAR image. By evaluating the uncertainty,\nour method alerts when the input SAR image is likely to be adversarially\ngenerated. Simultaneously, we also generate visual explanations that reveal the\nspecific regions in the SAR image where the adversarial scatterers are likely\nto to be present, thus aiding human decision-making with hints of evidence of\nadversarial attacks. Experiments on the MSTAR dataset demonstrate that our\napproach can identify over 80% adversarial SAR images with fewer than 20% false\nalarms, and our visual explanations can identify up to over 90% of scatterers\nin an adversarial SAR image.\n","authors":["Tian Ye","Rajgopal Kannan","Viktor Prasanna","Carl Busart"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18318v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08251v2","updated":"2024-03-27T07:33:42Z","published":"2022-12-16T02:43:52Z","title":"Task-Adaptive Saliency Guidance for Exemplar-free Class Incremental\n  Learning","summary":"  Exemplar-free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn\ntasks with access only to data from the current one.

To tackle this issue, we propose the Bias-to-Text (B2T)\nframework, which interprets visual biases as keywords. Specifically, we extract\ncommon keywords from the captions of mispredicted images to identify potential\nbiases in the model. We then validate these keywords by measuring their\nsimilarity to the mispredicted images using a vision-language scoring model.\nThe keyword explanation form of visual bias offers several advantages, such as\na clear group naming for bias discovery and a natural extension for debiasing\nusing these group names. Our experiments demonstrate that B2T can identify\nknown biases, such as gender bias in CelebA, background bias in Waterbirds, and\ndistribution shifts in ImageNet-R/C. Additionally, B2T uncovers novel biases in\nlarger datasets, such as Dollar Street and ImageNet. For example, we discovered\na contextual bias between \"bee\" and \"flower\" in ImageNet.

However,\nthis approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth\nhistopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs.\nRecently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by\ncombining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to\ndetect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In\nthis work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer\narchitectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a\ncomparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based\nprostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label\nnoise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer\nclassification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier\nwith MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that\nfor both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones\nlag behind their CNN counterparts. This deficit in performance is even more\nnoticeable for larger models. When using multi-objective learning, we can\nimprove performance of MIL, with a 77.9% AUROC, a sensitivity of 75.9%, and a\nspecificity of 66.3%. CONCLUSION: Convolutional networks are better suited for\nmodelling sparse datasets of prostate ultrasounds, producing more robust\nfeatures than transformers in PCa detection. Multi-scale methods remain the\nbest architecture for this task, with multi-objective learning presenting an\neffective way to improve performance.\n","authors":["Mohamed Harmanani","Paul F. R.
